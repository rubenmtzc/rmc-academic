abstract: From an economic perspective, trust among members of a society is associated with the efficient functioning of markets, contract reinforcement and in general with the capacity to generate development and welfare. In this article we empirically explore the determinants of trust in Mexico; in particular we isolate the relation among two measurements of social capital, one for the individual and another for their environment. Our results show that trust increases with these measurements of social capital, and in the absence of segregation, it is higher in smaller communities, at older ages and for inhabitants of the center-occident, among others.
