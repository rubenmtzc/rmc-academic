This project uses the Community Reporter model to engage with people across Leicester on their idea of a smart city. 
The aim of this approach is to facilitate opportunities to build a positive narrative around having voice that can influence social and economic policy. 
Leicester Stories is a hub that supports community media storytelling and discussion activities, both online and in person.
