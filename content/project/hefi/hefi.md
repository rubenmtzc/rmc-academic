Economic, social and health data is becoming ever more readily available as open data. Various organisations are trying to make this data more accessible to a general audience by producing data dashboards, interactive tools and/or information panels. In this project we will work with stakeholders to investigate how users interact with such data tools and whether they are able to draw correct inferences from the data. This will improve understanding of how to design data tools so that they can be effective in informing the relevant audience. We also investigate people's willigness to share personal different types of personal information with a different organisations.
