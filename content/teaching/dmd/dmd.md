This is an applied short-course about the design of digital markets. We cover topics in strategic decision making, strategic competition, pricing, economic networks, platforms, and market design, all this focusing on applications to the digital economy. During the lectures we will learn economic theory to study the design of digital bussinesses and markets. We will cover consumer analysis, market research, and strategic competition. We will also explore the economic implications of the Internet, digital technologies, artificial intelligence, and technological advances in general. During the course we will develop a project studying a new product, a new firm, or whole market applying what we will learn in the course.

Topics

- Markets
- Consumer analysis
- Strategic Competition
- Pricing strategies
- Economics of Networks
- Two-sided Platforms
- Market design: Auctions and Matching markets
- Digital economy
