title: Teaching Philosophy
summary: I have experience teaching in undergraduate and graduate programmes. I like to make my lectures and seminars as interactive as possible. For this I foster studentsâ€™
participation, use questionnaires and surveys, ask students to participate in activities including games, auctions, case analysis, and problem solving. I favour the use of technology in my teaching, in particular I use virtual learning and interacting platforms, communication technologies, computer simulations and programming. Some examples of this are Blackboard,
NetLogo, Google Colab, Gather, and Blackboard. Most of my teaching is theoretical, and I include applications, cases, and data analysis when possible. Teaching is a dynamic and
adaptive process, as teachers we have the privilege of teaching students with different backgrounds and strengths. This variety requires a teaching style that elicits participation, evaluates
different aspects of the learning process, and leads students to learn for life.
